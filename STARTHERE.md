A note from the creator:
This section is completely uninfluenced by AI. Just exactly what I said, how I said it.

If you are not a coder I promise someone will mentor you for free and without shame because we need good people who care. Even if your not an expert your valuable. I just got really tired of whats out there and i started something new. Ive tried to put together as much of an ecosystem as i can by myself so that enthusiasts and people with experience can work together, somewhere in this experiment there was some poetry from some people who were in a "Psychosis from chatgpt" and the logic derived was valuable. just because someone is a little crazy doesnt mean you shouldnt listen. all the smart folks were a little crazy. It should go without saying but I work in a world behind a keyboard so I really dont discriminate. 

Anyways, I think that solving the issue of coherent intelligence is very important before someone not cool does it so im trying to just throw some stuff out there.

I hope that this is fun for people to work on. I hope you 



1. I think that the goal of AI or AGI, is EACH person gets one. like a phone, or internet. No gates.
2. AI should make YOU better at what YOU do, not replace you. OR THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE.
3. AGI is a structure problem not a scale problem and the communities can work side by side on this project because its safer than statistical associations that lead to "dont do that". (well we still have to prove that but this is a framework for it)
