## Open Source Philosophy

While this project is licensed under the permissive MIT License, we strongly encourage contributors and integrators to prioritize open-source dependencies and services wherever possible. 

**Preferred Integrations:**
- **Messaging**: Matrix, Element, or other federated communication protocols
- **Voice/Telephone**: Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, or other self-hosted communication platforms
- **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted and decentralized solutions that align with our local-first philosophy

Our goal is to build a cognitive framework that remains accessible and free from vendor lock-in. While you're legally free to integrate with any service under this MIT license, we believe the future of AI should be built on open foundations that users can inspect, modify, and control.

This ensures that AI_OS instances remain tools for empowerment rather than dependency.
