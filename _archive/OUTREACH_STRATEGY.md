# Nola Outreach Strategy — Developer Access & Partnerships

> **Goal:** Establish integration partnerships and dev access before public launch.  
> **Approach:** Position as independent researcher/developer testing interoperability.  
> **Status:** Pre-launch, seeking API access and partnership discussions.

## The Pitch (Internal)

Nola is a local-first cognitive OS that can connect to any service. Companies benefit from being "Nola-compatible" because:

1. **Users bring their AI to your platform** — Zero onboarding friction
2. **Their AI already knows their preferences** — Better UX from day one
3. **You're a module, not a silo** — Users don't have to choose between you and their AI

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Developer API Access (General)

**Subject:** API Access Request — Building Local-First AI Integration

```
Hi [Name/Team],

I'm building an open-source cognitive framework called Nola that enables 
local-first AI with persistent memory and multi-service integration.

I'm reaching out to request developer API access to [Platform]. My goal is 
to build a high-quality integration that lets users:
- [Specific use case 1 for this platform]
- [Specific use case 2 for this platform]

The project is focused on user privacy and data sovereignty — all processing 
happens locally, and users control what data flows where.

Current status:
- Working prototype with 23+ passing tests
- React dashboard with one-click launch
- Stimuli router supporting 20+ platforms (config-driven)
- SQLite-backed memory with hierarchical fact storage

I'd love to discuss API access or any developer programs that might fit. 
Happy to share a demo or technical documentation.

Best,
[Your name]
[GitHub link]
```

### Template 2: Partnership Discussion (Aligned Companies)

**Subject:** Potential Partnership — Personal AI That Works With [Platform]

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following [Company]'s work on [specific thing they do well], and 
I think there's a natural alignment with what I'm building.

Nola is a local-first cognitive OS — think "personal AI that actually 
remembers you, runs on your machine, and connects to your tools." The core 
insight: instead of every app having its own AI, users have ONE AI that 
integrates with everything.

For [Platform], this means:
- Users arrive with context already loaded (their AI knows their preferences)
- Lower onboarding friction
- Deeper engagement (your platform becomes part of their AI ecosystem)

I'm pre-launch and looking to establish key integrations before going public. 
Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

I can share:
- Technical architecture docs
- Working demo
- Integration specifications

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 3: Research/Academic Framing

**Subject:** Research Collaboration — Hierarchical Experiential Attention

```
Hi [Name],

I'm an independent researcher working on cognitive architectures for 
personalized AI. My current project implements what I call "Hierarchical 
Experiential Attention" (HEA) — a framework that separates experiential 
memory from the base LLM.

The key contributions:
- Dual-process model (probabilistic + experiential attention)
- Structured state management decoupled from model weights
- Context levels mapped to cognitive load (L1/L2/L3)
- Model-agnostic architecture (works with any LLM)

I'm exploring how this integrates with [Platform/API] and would appreciate 
developer access to build and test the integration.

Paper draft and implementation available on request.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 4: Open Source Community Outreach

**Subject:** Open Source AI Project — Looking for Early Feedback

```
Hi,

I'm about to open-source a project I've been working on solo since April — 
a local-first cognitive framework that gives any LLM persistent memory and 
structured identity.

Before launch, I'm reaching out to a few people/communities whose work I 
respect for early feedback:
- Is the architecture sound?
- What integrations would make this useful for you?
- Any obvious gaps I'm missing?

Quick overview:
- SQLite-backed identity and fact storage
- Async "subconscious" threads (Who/What/Where/When/Why)
- HEA context levels for cognitive load management
- One-click local deployment
- Cloud-optional (works with local models or API)

Happy to share access to the repo or do a walkthrough call.

[Your name]
```

## Outreach Sequence

### Week 1-2: API Access
1. Apply to all standard developer programs (Google, Notion, Linear, etc.)
2. Join Discord/Slack communities for relevant platforms
3. Engage genuinely before asking (comment on issues, help others)

### Week 3-4: Direct Outreach
1. Identify developer relations contacts (LinkedIn, Twitter)
2. Send personalized emails (not mass blasts)
3. Follow up once after 5-7 days, then leave it

### Week 5-6: Community Building
1. Post in r/LocalLLaMA, r/selfhosted, Hacker News (Show HN when ready)
2. Engage with Ollama, LM Studio communities
3. Find early adopters who will actually use it

### Pre-Launch: Partnership Announcements
1. "Nola supports X out of the box" builds credibility
2. Integration partners get early mention in launch materials
3. Creates network effect before public launch

---

## What You're Offering Partners

1. **Early integration** — Their platform works on day one
2. **Privacy-conscious users** — Your audience self-selects for quality
3. **Documentation** — You'll write the integration guide
4. **Feedback loop** — Real user testing before you go wide
5. **Co-marketing potential** — "Nola-compatible" badge, joint announcements

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Don't oversell scale you don't have yet
- Don't promise exclusivity you can't deliver
- Don't spam — one thoughtful email > ten generic ones
- Don't reveal full marketplace/business model yet (keep that for later)
- Don't position as "competitor" to anything — you're "complementary"
