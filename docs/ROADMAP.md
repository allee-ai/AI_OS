# AI OS Roadmap

> **Status:** Early release. Core works, edges are rough. Looking for collaborators.  
> **Author's Note:** Built solo since April 2025. The architecture is solid, but this needs to be a community effort to reach its potential.

## Description

### The Vision

AI OS isn't a chatbot. It's a **Cognitive Operating System** — an open-source framework that gives any LLM a persistent identity, hierarchical memory, and the ability to *grow* through experience rather than retraining.

**The problem:** If you want memory, identity, context management, and background processing for a local LLM, you're currently stitching together 5+ libraries and writing glue code. There's no integrated package.

**What AI OS provides:** One system with all the cognitive architecture pieces — memory (short/long term), identity persistence, attention budgeting, fact extraction, background consolidation — already wired together.

**The methodology:** Retrieval-augmented prompting. Clear, structured context produces better model outputs — this is established prompt engineering. AI OS makes that structure *visible and controllable*: you see what context is being retrieved, how it's organized, and why. A smaller model with well-curated context outperforms a larger model with flat context for identity coherence, fact recall, and personality stability.

### Current State

| Layer | Status | What's Working |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Core** | [WIP] | Threads, HEA, SQLite backend, stateless agent |
| **UI** | [WIP] | React app, chat, thread visualization |
| **Integrations** | [~] | Feeds system built, needs OAuth + polling daemon |
| **Advanced** | [--] | Philosophy thread exists. Reflex has API/schema. Visual builder planned. |

### Future: The Ecosystem

**Plugin Marketplace** — A modular ecosystem for extending AI OS:
- Predefined personalities (e.g., assistant, tutor, coach)
- Predefined knowledgebases (e.g., medical, legal, creative)
- Calendar as a feed
- Domain-specific plugins for specialized tasks

**Enterprise Edition:**
- Multi-user with role-based access
- Compliance and audit logging
- On-prem deployment packages

**Research Platform:**
- Cognitive science experiments
- Memory consolidation studies
- Identity stability benchmarks

### Big Milestones

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **1. Memory** | Facts get promoted based on importance | 90% |
| **2. Philosophy** | Moral compass, value-guided behavior | Planned |
| **3. Reflex** | Visual automation, 10x pattern learning | Planned |
| **4. Dream** | Personality through synthetic experience | Planned |
| **5. Multi-Model** | Right model for right task | Planned |
| **6. Beyond Chat** | Background presence via Feeds | Foundation done |

## AI-Native Development Loop

> _The innovation moat: an open platform where humans AND AI models collaborate on cognitive architecture._

### The Insight

**Why put your AI architecture idea anywhere else?**

AI OS becomes the default destination for cognitive architecture innovation because:
1. **Your ideas get seen** — By contributors, researchers, AND the AI models themselves
2. **Models have skin in the game** — Claude, GPT, Gemini all participate in Discussions
3. **Ideas become code faster** — Roadmap → Issues → PRs is automated
4. **Credit is preserved** — Your idea, your name, tracked through implementation

### The Daily Flow

```

### Implementation

- [ ] **Idea Discussions board** — Structured template for cognitive architecture proposals
- [ ] **Model voices** — Scheduled API calls to Claude/GPT to comment on new Discussions
- [ ] **Idea-to-Issue pipeline** — Approved ideas auto-create GitHub Issues with full context
- [ ] **Roadmap sync** — Issues auto-populate module roadmaps
- [ ] **Attribution tracking** — Original idea author credited through to CHANGELOG
- [ ] **Domain tagging** — Ideas tagged by cognitive domain (memory, identity, attention, etc.)
- [ ] **Upvote weighting** — Community + model votes determine priority

### Why This Wins

| Traditional OSS | AI-Native Development |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Ideas in Issues (unstructured) | Ideas in Discussions (structured, debated) |
| Maintainer bottleneck | AI triage + community consensus |
| Ideas get lost | Ideas tracked through implementation |
| One perspective | Multiple AI models + humans |
| Slow feedback | Real-time model input |

### The Moat

Once this exists:
- **Researchers** post here because models respond
- **Builders** post here because ideas become code
- **Models** "watch" here because it's where the action is
- **Everyone else** follows the gravity

**First-mover advantage in AI-assisted open source.**
