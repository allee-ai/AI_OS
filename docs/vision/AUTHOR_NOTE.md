# A Note from the Creator

I built this program from a simple idea: if you imagine the entire conversation or "generation" of the machine as concurrent math functions, the 5 W's—who, what, where, when, and why—become muddled, invalid, or changed variables. So I figured, why not make the variables change on purpose and with control?

## What This Actually Is (For Normal People)

Think of current AI like a really smart parrot. It can say brilliant things, but it doesn't remember who it talked to yesterday, doesn't have consistent opinions, and basically resets its entire personality every conversation. It's all knowledge with no *self*.

This program gives the AI a persistent sense of self—like a human has. It remembers who it is, what it believes, what happened to it, and how those experiences should change its personality over time. It's not AGI (artificial general intelligence), but it's the first step toward AI that acts like an actual entity rather than just a very sophisticated autocomplete.

Most importantly: **you control this entity**. You can edit its personality, see exactly how it "thinks," and everything runs on your computer. No corporate overlords deciding what your AI can or can't help you with.

It's like the difference between talking to a Wikipedia that forgot it was Wikipedia every 5 minutes, versus talking to a consistent person who happens to be really smart.

*This section is completely uninfluenced by AI. Just exactly what I said, how I said it.*

If you are not a coder, I promise someone will mentor you for free and without shame because we need good people who care. Even if you're not an expert, you're valuable. I just got really tired of what's out there and started something new. I've tried to put together as much of an ecosystem as I can by myself so that enthusiasts and people with experience can work together.

Somewhere in this experiment there was some poetry from people who were in a "psychosis from ChatGPT" and the logic derived was valuable. Just because someone is a little crazy doesn't mean you shouldn't listen. All the smart folks were a little crazy. It should go without saying, but I work in a world behind a keyboard so I really don't discriminate.

Anyway, I think that solving the issue of coherent intelligence is very important before someone not cool does it, so I'm trying to just throw some stuff out there.

I hope that this is fun for people to work on.

## Core Principles

1. **I think that the goal of AI or AGI is EACH person gets one**—like a phone, or internet. No gates.

2. **AI should make YOU better at what YOU do, not replace you. Or the people in your life.**

3. **AGI is a structure problem, not a scale problem**, and communities can work side by side on this project because it's safer than statistical associations that lead to "don't do that." (Well, we still have to prove that, but this is a framework for it.)
