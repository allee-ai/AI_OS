<!-- Archived: Full developer notes moved from docs/DEV_NOTES.md on 2026-01-12 -->

The project's detailed developer notes were archived to reduce noise in the main docs index.

If you need the full historical development notes, they remain in the repository history or can be restored by request.

Summary of content moved here:
- Cleanup logs, architecture discovery, focus system plans, backend/frontend changes, testing notes, and long-form implementation checklists.

For current developer onboarding, see `docs/DEV_QUICKSTART.md` and `docs/CONSOLIDATED_INDEX.md` which summarize current priorities.
