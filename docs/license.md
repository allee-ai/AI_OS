Aligned OS Public License (AOSPL-1.0) 
Section 1: Scope and Purpose 
This license governs the use, distribution, and 
modification of the Aligned OS architecture and all 
associated documentation, design patterns, and structured 
configurations (collectively, “the System”). 
The purpose of this license is to preserve the openness, 
transparency, and structural integrity of Aligned OS while 
ensuring that its core innovations remain attributable, 
inspectable, and free from enclosure by closed-source or 
for-profit derivatives without permission. 
Aligned OS was designed as a public cognitive 
infrastructure — not a product, but a framework for safe, 
personal, and inspectable intelligence. This license 
ensures that: 
• Individuals, nonprofits, and research institutions may 
freely use, adapt, and extend the System for non-
commercial purposes; 
• Commercial entities or for-profit integrations may do 
so only with explicit written permission from the 
author or governing trust; 
• The architecture, terminology, routing design, and 
modular thread structure remain protected from 
proprietary replication, obfuscation, or rebranding. 
This license is intended to support ethical development, 
collaborative research, and long-term public access to 
aligned system design. It is not a waiver of intellectual 
ownership, but an invitation to build safely — together. 
Section 2: Definitions

defined as follows:
