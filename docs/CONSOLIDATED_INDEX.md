# Consolidated Documentation Index

This file summarizes the project's documentation, highlights which docs are clearly current (from the changelog), which are archived, and which need review or updating to reflect the codebase. Use this as the single source-of-truth for triaging doc work.

Summary
- **Scope scanned:** `docs/` (core docs, implementation, theory, archive) and thread READMEs under `Nola/threads/`.
- **Heuristic:** A doc is marked **Recent** if it's referenced in `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` with a 2025-12/2026-01 entry; otherwise it is marked **Needs review** unless in `docs/archive/` (marked **Archived**).

Actionable high-level recommendations
- Fix the tests/docs drift: ensure `tests/` references (eg. `idv2`) match code or provide compatibility shims.
- Add a small "What to run first" checklist to `README.md` (run tests + smoke start) — quick reviewers will look for it.
- Move operational notes out of `DEV_NOTES.md` into smaller, focused docs for onboarding and maintainability.
- Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and a `docs/REPO_HEALTH.md` with build/test/security status.

Docs inventory (high level)

- `README.md` — Recent: landing & quickstart (keep concise)
- `docs/README.md` — Recent: index of docs (good)
- `docs/DEV_NOTES.md` — Recent: long developer notes (split into smaller onboarding docs)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Recent: roadmap and phases (keep, trim for public view)
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — Recent: handoff checklist (keep)
- `docs/FOCUS_CHECKLIST.md` — Recent: implementation checklist (keep)
- `docs/implementation/FOCUS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Recent: core implementation plan (keep)
- `docs/implementation/database_integration_plan.md` — Recent: DB plan (keep)
- `docs/implementation/troubleshooting.md` — Recent: troubleshooting (keep)
- `docs/theory/*` — Recent: research papers and theory (keep; consider a TL;DR doc for reviewers)
- `docs/archive/*` — Archived: historical items (leave in archive)
- `docs/license.md` — Recent: license (keep)

Thread README notes (where found)
- Each thread under `Nola/threads/` contains a README describing the thread architecture (identity, log, linking_core, form, reflex, temp_memory). These are authoritative for implementation details. Treat thread READMEs as canonical for that thread.

Suggested file-level TODOs (short, actionable)
- `docs/DEV_NOTES.md`: Extract a short `docs/DEV_QUICKSTART.md` (3 steps: setup venv, run tests, start app). Mark: `Needs action`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Add a one-paragraph "Run tests" section with the exact commands used in CI. Mark: `High priority`.
- `docs/README.md`: Add a one-line table cell: "Run tests" with exact commands. Mark: `Quick win`.

How to proceed (recommended execution plan)
1. Create `docs/DEV_QUICKSTART.md` with 3 commands: `./install.sh`, `./runtests.sh --unit`, `./start.sh`.
2. Add `docs/REPO_HEALTH.md` with CI status, last green commit hash, and top 3 blockers (tests failing, path quirks).
3. Split `DEV_NOTES.md` into `docs/guides/QUICKSTART.md` + `DEV_DETAILED.md` (archive the long file or move to `docs/archive/` once trimmed).

Notes and caveats
- This consolidation used the repository `CHANGELOG.md` to infer recency. Manual review is still required for semantic accuracy (for example, you mentioned `idv2` was deleted — tests still reference it). Where code and docs disagree, pick a canonical implementation and update tests/docs accordingly.
- Thread READMEs are authoritative for implementation details; prefer updating those over cross-referencing long `DEV_NOTES.md` sections.

If you want, I can:
- (A) Create `docs/DEV_QUICKSTART.md` and `docs/REPO_HEALTH.md` now, or
- (B) Implement a compatibility shim for `idv2` so tests pass, then run the suite and iterate.
