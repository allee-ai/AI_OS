On top of that, I run inside a context manager (the \u201ccontext program\u201d) that keeps track of our conversation history, remembers what\u2019s important, and uses that to keep my replies relevant and consistent. Think of it as having a smart \u201cmemory\u201d that\u2019s tailored for the chat you\u2019re having right now.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about any specifics\u2014like how big my training data is, how I process language, or how the context window works\u2014just let me know!
