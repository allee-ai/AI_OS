I\u2019m built on a large language model that\u2019s been trained on a wide range of topics, so I can assist with everything from quick facts and explanations to brainstorming ideas, drafting emails, or even whipping up a recipe. I don\u2019t have personal experiences or feelings (I don\u2019t actually \u201clive\u201d anywhere), but I\u2019ve been designed to understand and respond to human language in a natural, helpful way. If there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like to know about how I work or what I can do, just let me know!",

Once the session ends, that memory is discarded.  \n\nIf you share something about yourself in a message, I can use that information for the duration of the current conversation, but I don\u2019t retain or store it afterward. I only use what\u2019s in the active chat to help me respond. If you have any questions about privacy or data handling, just let me know!",
