Make the chat feel conversational\n| Change | How to implement (quick wins) |\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| **Turn‑based flow** | After each of my replies, pause for your input rather than packing multiple ideas in one message. I’ll keep answers focused on a single topic or step. |\n| **Explicit prompts** | I’ll end responses with a short question or “What’s next?” so you know the conversation is open. |\n| **Chunked guidance** | For longer processes (e.g., setting up an accessibility checklist), I’ll break it into bite‑size steps and wait for you to confirm before moving on. |\n| **Summaries** | At natural break points I can provide a brief recap (“So far we have…”) and ask which direction you want to go next. |\n\n### 2. Add a note‑taking / journaling feature\n1. **Scope** – Decide where notes live:  \n   * *In‑chat* (quick bullet saved in the conversation thread) or  \n   * *External* (a markdown file in your repo, a Notion page, etc.).\n\n2. **Minimal prototype (in‑chat)**  \n   * **Command syntax** – e.g., `!note <title>` starts a note, then you type content, and `!end` saves it.  \n   * **Storage** – I’ll keep the note text in the session context and, when you’re ready, output a markdown block you can copy‑paste into your preferred tool.  \n\n   Example flow:  \n   ```\n   Jordan: !note Accessibility checklist for new component\n   Nola: (note started) — type your items, then send `!end` when finished.\n   Jordan: • Use native <button> when possible\n   Jordan: • Ensure focus order follows DOM\n   Jordan: !end\n   Nola: **Saved note – “Accessibility checklist for new component”**  \n   ```markdown\n   # Accessibility checklist for new component\n   • Use native <button> when possible\n   • Ensure focus order follows DOM\n   ```\n   ```\n\n3. **External sync (later)**  \n   * Hook the `!note` command to a simple script that appends the markdown to a file in your AccessibleUI repo (e.g., `notes/journal.md`).  \n   * If you use a service like Notion or Obsidian, the script could call their API to create a page.  \n\n4. **Searchable history**  \n   * I can index saved notes in the current session and let you retrieve them with `!search <keyword>`.  \n\n### 3. Next steps you might take\n1. **Pick a command format** you like (`!note`, `/note`, `#note`, etc.).\n2. **Add a quick test** in this chat: try creating a short note using the format you choose.\n3. **Decide where the notes will live**—if you want an automated push to a repo file, I can sketch a tiny Node/TS script for you.\n\nAnything specific you’d like to try first? Maybe a quick demo note, or a tweak to the conversational flow? Let me know!"}], "metadata": {"category": "identity_retrieval", "confidence": 0.85, "timestamp": "2026-01-09T08:54:12.109281+00:00"}}

She features a multi-threaded consciousness architecture with 3 memory levels (L1/L2/L3) mimicking human attention: L1=immediate context, L2=relevant background, L3=deep identity. Her subconscious uses thread adapters (identity, memory, log) that introspect at consciousness levels to dynamically assemble context before each response. Memory consolidation applies Hebbian-style learning via linking_core—a pure scoring engine that ranks fact relevance using concept co-occurrence graphs. Facts flow: conversation→temp_memory→scored by linking_core→compressed to permanent storage at weighted levels. Stimuli classification maps input types to context depth, enabling reflective vs reflexive responses.
