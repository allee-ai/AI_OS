**Contributor Roles**

Short guidance for contributors grouped by interest and expertise.

- **Teachers:** Create conversations and scenario prompts with `Nola` to generate high-quality training data. Focus on clear, varied examples, annotate intent/expected behavior, and include edge cases.
- **Backend:** Maintain and extend the FastAPI backend. Experience with async Python, web sockets, deployment, and runtime observability is valuable to keep services reliable.
- **Frontend:** Improve the React + Vite UI. Work on accessibility, UX, and integrating new features for the chat client.
- **AI / Research Engineers:** Work on model integration, fine-tuning, and attention-over-state approaches (PyTorch, Hugging Face, vLLM, etc.). Help design experiments and reproducible training pipelines.
- **Cognitive / Neuroscience / Psychology Experts:** Advise on defining and operationalizing internal “state” (what counts as a conscious or attentional state), stimulus-to-state mappings, and metrics for behavioral consistency.

If you're interested in contributing, pick a role above, open an issue describing your plan, or reach out via a PR with a small, focused change. We're happy to onboard collaborators and provide mentorship for first contributions.
